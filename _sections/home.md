 Discoverability is a concept of growing use in digital cultural policy, but it lacks a clear and comprehensive definition. Typically, discoverability is narrowly defined as a problem for content creators to find an audience given an abundance of choice. This view misses the important ways that apps, online stores, streaming services, and other platforms coordinate the experiences of content discovery.
